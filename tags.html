	<h1>Weston Wernette</h1>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>	My real name is the big W. I weigh 65 pounds, and was born in Harlem. I live with twelve pitbulls in my San Diego home on the water. I'm an aspiring water polo player. I also have played in the Canadian Football league. </p>
	<h2> Life Goals </h2>
	<p> First, I would like to make an olympic water polo team at some point in my life. I haven't started training but I still have plenty of time. I'd also like to graduate from Ballard high school one day. When I'm older I hope to be able to drive a car and cook my own dinner. </p>
